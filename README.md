# Bitcask - A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key/Value Data

[![Erlang CI Actions Status](https://github.com/basho/bitcask/workflows/Erlang%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/basho/bitcask/actions)

Bitcask uses the "rebar" build system, but we have provided a wrapper
Makefile so that simply running "make" at the top level should work.

Bitcask requires Erlang R14B04 or later.
